# 20-Questions-Game

• In this project, we proposed a novel approach based on knowledge graph for designing the 20Q game on Bollywood movies. 
• The system assumes the role of the questioner and asks questions to predict the movie thought by the answerer. 
• It uses a probabilistic learning model for template-based question generation and answers prediction. A dataset of interrelated entities is represented as a weighted knowledge graph, which updates as the game progresses by asking questions. 
• An evolutionary approach helps the model to gain a better understanding of user choices and predicts the answer in fewer questions over time. 
• Experimental results show that our model was able to predict the correct movie in less than 10 questions for more than half of the times the game was played.
